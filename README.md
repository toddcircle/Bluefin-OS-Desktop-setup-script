# GNOME Setup Script

This script sets the following GNOME desktop preferences 

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Dual-sided window control buttons**  
  (Mac + Window$ style) I sometimes get confused moving the mouse to close the window only to find the contorls are on the other side.
  Problem solved.

- **Right-click on titlebar or window borders**  
  Throws the window to the back of the pile if you have multiple open windows on top of each other, to quickly find the one you're after.
  I Can't understand why this isn't enabled and used as default, so useful.

- **Natural scrolling for mouse**  
  The the way it *should* be.

- **Nautilus text location**  
  Uses the full text path in Nautilus, more practicle.
